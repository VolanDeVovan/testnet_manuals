### Run celestia devnet-2 (rpc, bridge, light)
This script does not include validator creation as faucet for devnet is disabled and running validator is not necessary at this stage
```
wget -O celestia_devnet.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VolanDeVovan/testnet_manuals/main/celestia/celestia_devnet.sh && chmod +x celestia_devnet.sh && ./celestia_devnet.sh
```

As alternative you can setup Celestia nodes manually by following guides provided by community member mzonder
